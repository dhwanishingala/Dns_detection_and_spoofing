the arguments in command line are parsed using argparser. it takes the values and if the interface is not assigned then sets default interface.
netifaces is used for interface details. and scapy command sniff implements the injection logic.

Sniffs packets that match filter ( + udp port 53) on specified interface (if not specified, use default interface.) If a hostname file is 
specified, check if entry for domain name requested in captured packet is present in file. If yes, spoof the answer with ip address 
mentioned in the entry in file. Do nothing, otherwise. If no hostname file is specified, spoof answer section of all captured packets with 
IP address of local machine's default interface.
